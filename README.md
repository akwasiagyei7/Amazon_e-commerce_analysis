# 📊 Amazon E-Commerce Data Analysis

## 📝 Introduction
This project analyzes **Amazon e-commerce data** to uncover insights into **product performance, customer preferences, and pricing strategies**. 
The analysis is conducted using Python (Jupyter Notebook).

## Problem Statement
Amazon generates vast amounts of sales data, but businesses need clear insights into:
- Identifying top-performing products based on ratings.
- Understanding the relationship between price and rating.
- Evaluating category-wise product performance.
- Analyzing product popularity based on customer engagement.
- Generating KPIs for business decisions.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing in **Pandas**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- Feature Engineering for deeper insights
- Visualization with **Tableau (Dashboard to be added)**
- Statistical Analysis for pricing impact

## Data Sourcing
- The dataset was sourced from **Amazon's public dataset**.

## Data Processing
- **Handled missing values** (Removed NA values from rating count).
- **Converted data types** for numerical processing.
- **Filtered relevant product categories** for comparison.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### 1️⃣ Top Performing Products by Rating
- Products were ranked based on **average customer rating**.
- High-rated products were identified in **electronics, books, and fashion**.

### 2️⃣ Price vs. Rating Analysis
- **Scatterplot**: Shows the relationship between **discounted price** and **ratings**.
- **Boxplot**: Compares rating distributions across different **price ranges**.

### 3️⃣ **Category Performance Analysis**
- Identified **best-selling categories**.
- Evaluated **customer engagement** by **review count and rating trends**.

## 🏆 Conclusion & Recommendations
- **Low-cost products** tend to receive **higher ratings**, but not always the best reviews.
- **Electronics & Books** are the most engaged categories.
- Businesses should **adjust pricing strategies** based on **customer sentiment**.
