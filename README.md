# 📊 Amazon E-Commerce Data Analysis

## 📝 Introduction
This project analyzes **Amazon e-commerce data** to uncover insights into **product performance, customer preferences, and pricing strategies**. 
The analysis is conducted using Python (Jupyter Notebook).

## Problem Statement
Amazon generates vast amounts of sales data, but businesses need clear insights into:
- Identifying top-performing products based on ratings.
- Understanding the relationship between price and rating.
- Evaluating category-wise product performance.
- Analyzing product popularity based on customer engagement.
- Generating KPIs for business decisions.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing in **Pandas**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- Feature Engineering for deeper insights
- Statistical Analysis for pricing impact

## Data Sourcing
- The dataset was sourced from **Amazon's public dataset**.

## Data Processing
- **Handled missing values** (Removed NA values from rating count).
- **Converted data types** for numerical processing.
- **Filtered relevant product categories** for comparison.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### 1️⃣ Top Performing Products by Rating
- Products were ranked based on **average customer rating**.
- High-rated products were identified in **electronics, books, and fashion**.

### 2️⃣ Price vs. Rating Analysis
- **Scatterplot**: Shows the relationship between **discounted price** and **ratings**.
- **Boxplot**: Compares rating distributions across different **price ranges**.

### 3️⃣ **Category Performance Analysis**
- Identified **best-selling categories**.
- Evaluated **customer engagement** by **review count and rating trends**.

## 🏆 Conclusion & Recommendations
📌 **Key Takeaways:**
1. **Niche products** like **coffee frothers and specialty kitchen tools** tend to have high ratings (4.5–5.0) but lower review counts.
2. **Premium products** such as **high-end electronics and smart home devices** receive high ratings but have fewer total reviews compared to budget products.
3. **Low-cost items** like **AmazonBasics accessories and HDMI cables** generate the highest engagement due to affordability and high demand.
4. **Electronics and Home Accessories** are the top-rated categories, while **power/network accessories** need improvement.
5. **Highly reviewed products (like AmazonBasics HDMI cables) indicate strong demand** → Leveraging these insights can boost sales.

📌 **Recommendations:**
1. **Improve marketing for premium products** by highlighting unique features and leveraging influencer partnerships.
2. **Optimize descriptions and visuals for low-cost products** to maintain engagement while improving customer trust.
3. **Enhance product quality and customer service in low-rated categories** like power/network accessories to improve brand reputation.
